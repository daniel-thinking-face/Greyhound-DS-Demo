# Greyhound DS Demo
 
 This is a demonstration repo of using modelling to predict greyhound races.  I chose this as this was a project I embarked on when I was learning data science to showcase my skills.
 
 Here I go through a very basic run through of the end to end process.
 
 
 ## ![Data Acquisition](https://github.com/daniel-thinking-face/Greyhound-DS-Demo/tree/main/Webscraper%20Cloud%20Build)
 
 
 First I demonstrate the acquisition process by building a scraper to acquire the information and save into a Google BigQuery table.  This function is house in GCP as a cloud funtion
 
 ## ![Feature and Modelling](https://github.com/daniel-thinking-face/Greyhound-DS-Demo/tree/main/Feature%20and%20Modelling%20Notebooks)
 
 Some notebooks to show some feature development in python as well as how we can apply a simple Tensoflow model on the data
